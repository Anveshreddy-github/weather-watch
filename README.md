Weather watch: Weather reporting service that goes beyond traditional forecasts. In addition to provide up-to-date weather information, this service offers valuable guidance to individuals and communities facing the threat of floods. By monitoring and analysing weather patterns, river levels and potential flood risks, our platform not only informs users about the impending danger but also suggests alternative safe locations to seek refuge. This innovative approach aims to enhance public safety and resilience in the face of severe weather events, ensuring that people can make informed decisions and find shelter in times of crisis. “Weather Watch” is not just a weather report; it’s a lifeline in turbulent times.
